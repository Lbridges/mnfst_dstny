Development Environment Control Freak seeks git as buffer between local and live WordPress installs

I have a WP theme that I developed using Underscores. I want to continue to develop it locally, because that is what's comfortable for me, but I need a live version up and running because I am currently looking for work -so every sample I can produce that lives on the internet is just going to get me that much closer to a new client.

Obviously, if there is anything here that anyone else can use, help yourself!

And if I do anything cool and out of the ordinary with this theme, I will be sure to update this readme. But, for now, it is just a basic theme that follows the guidelines produced by a Lynda course on WP theme development.
